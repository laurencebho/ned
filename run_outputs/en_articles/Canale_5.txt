The current logo of the network is a 5 overlapped by the stylized head of Biscione (reference to the Visconti family and the city of Milan), from whose mouth, unlike the original, comes out a flower. There is also a second interpretation, according to which the queue of the Biscione is placed at five (even if the 5 is written with a typographical font).
The first promotional slogan of Canale 5 was: Corri a casa in tutta fretta, c'è un Biscione che ti aspetta.

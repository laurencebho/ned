This is a list of towns in the Dutch province of Gelderland. Note that in the Netherlands, there is no official distinction between cities, towns, villages, etc., and therefore this category contains all of these kinds of settlements, from the city of Nijmegen (population: about 160,000) to the smallest hamlets.

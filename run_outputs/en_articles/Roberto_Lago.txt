== Football career ==


=== Celta ===
Born in Vigo, Galicia, Lago was a product of hometown RC Celta de Vigo's youth system. He made his debut with the first team in the 2007–08 season, playing 33 matches for the Segunda División side which eventually finished 17th one year after being relegated. In the following years he was an undisputed starter when available, contributing with 35 games and one goal in the 2011–12 campaign as the club returned to La Liga.Lago's maiden appearance in the top flight was on 18 August 2012, starting in a 0–1 home loss against Málaga CF. He only missed four contests during the season, as Celta eventually stayed up at the expense of neighbouring Deportivo de La Coruña.


=== Getafe ===
Lago joined fellow league club Getafe CF on 12 June 2013, signing a four-year contract. During his three-year spell at the Coliseum Alfonso Pérez, which was often marred by injury, he appeared in 58 competitive games.
In July 2016, following the team's top flight relegation, Lago left by triggering a release clause in his contract.


=== APOEL ===
On 9 July 2016, at nearly 31, Lago moved abroad for the first time in his career, penning a two-year deal with reigning Cypriot champions APOEL FC. He made his official debut on 10 September, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–0 away victory against Nea Salamis Famagusta FC for the First Division.
